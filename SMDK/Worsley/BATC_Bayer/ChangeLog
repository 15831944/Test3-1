	* BATCBayerSM.cpp: Added KEq constants to access window.

	* BATCBayerSM.cpp: Finally tracked down discrepency between BRAHMA
	and SysCAD to use of modified constants. KEq_A1 etc. These can be
	set and saved in the original BRAHMA program, but only with
	password which we never had. BRAHMA then reads the constants when
	loading a project from a binary file xxxxx.phd - tcl script to
	fish the numbers from this file: new values (and original ones) are 
	KEq_A1 = -55320;     (-64149;)  
	KEq_B1 = 0.4592752;  (69.92; )   
	KEq_C1 = 139.8;	     (166.465;) 

	binary scan [read [open "190701.phd"]] f* val
	puts $val

	Added these as static variables to class: can implement these in
	access window if necessary.

	* brahma_acsat.cpp: sqrt(exp(x))==exp(x/2.)

	* BATC_Bayer.cpp (DllMain): Still sorting out path hell: the 
	#pragma LIBCOMMENT causes problems; I put all this stuff in 
	the makefile, but the MS compiler seems to get confused when
	this is inlined.

	* Bayer.for (BAYER): Modifications proposed to Bayer.for:
	1. Remove all string stuff, this just returns character names for
	the various species, and these are different to the SysCAD ones
	anyway, so they are no use to anyone.
	 - OutCompName
	 - OCName
	 - GammaName
	 - SIName
	 - SolName
	 (INIT): Deleted string settings of these

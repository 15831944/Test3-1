	* QALHeater.cpp (EvalProducts): Fixup for shellside scaling.

2006-09-18  Rod Stephenson  <rod.stephenson@transcritical.com>

	* makefile (OBJS): Changed directory structure: removed GLADDY
	local definitions.

2006-05-04  Rod Stephenson  <rod.stephenson@transcritical.com>

	* QALPrecip.cpp: Switched on evap/thermal loss code

	* QALHeater.cpp (EvalProducts): Added in shell side scaling: it
	was implemented in access window but not main routine. 

	* QALClassifier.cpp: Fixed bug in main classifier routine: when
	the PutMassPassing() function went away, the replacement with
	putFrac() was incorrectly implemented.

	* QALPrecip.cpp: Added new QAL nucleation rate model. This is used
	when the CAR-QAL model for *growth* is selected.
	Added QAL growth rate equation.

	* QALClassifier.cpp: There is a bug here that appears when there
	are *no* solids present. Need to add a check here, but not sure
	how this should be handled.

	* CalcSeparation. Changed constant 1.9->3.89 and added density
	term. 

	* QALCyclone.cpp (EvalProducts): On exception was setting both
	underflow and overflow to input. Now set overflow to input and
	underflow to zero. 
	

	Immediate check for PSD.

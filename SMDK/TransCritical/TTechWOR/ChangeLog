	* TTWorClassPrecip.cpp: Added ClassPrecip classifying precipitator
	to hold the wierdness

	* TTWORPrecip.cpp (EvalProducts): Added vebose option to print
	error messages for bad stream conditions

	* TTWORFilter.cpp: Added Verbose option to print out additional
	errors and warnings, 
	-- Failure to achieve desired cake density - ie too much solids in
	feed
	-- Failure to achieve pure water cake liquour - not necessarily an
	error since will always happen if no condensate added

	* TTWORClassifier.cpp: Move displayPSD's inside streamOK block

	* TTWORPrecip.cpp (EvalProducts): Added checkbox for using saved
	tank data for restart: if streams are jumping around the rates
	calculated from the save tank data can lead to instability. 

	* TTWORFilter.cpp: Error message when incoming feed has higher
	solids than specified cake density. No error message when pure
	water cake liquor not achievable - latter is common when no condy
	stream is attached.

	Moved displayPSD's inside streamOK check: calling this for non PSD
	stream is error.

	* TTWORPrecip.cpp (EvalPrecipRates): Tidying up restart
	code. Added SavedTank stream to store tank state between
	runs. Intention is to use this to calculate rates for first
	iteration to get "close" to converged state.

	* TTWORPrecip.h (CPrecip): Made HOR functions inline:

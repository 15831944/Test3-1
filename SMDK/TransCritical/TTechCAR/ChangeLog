	* TTCARPrecip.cpp: Replaced SetF() with full deep copy to carry
	property information to cooling water outlet...

	* CARTubeDigester.cpp: Fixup of LMTD calculation for
	SimpleHeater. The upper limit temperature for TubeOut was causing
	problems: this is set because the streams may have different
	thermal capacities and having an upper limit of ShellIn.T would
	cause crossover in the LMTD calculation. However the LMTD calc
	has absolute values, which gave erroenous results when crossover
	occurred.

	So replaced LMTD with penalty value when crossover occurs. The
	Brent Solver should pick this up in pathological cases.

	* CARTubeDigester.cpp (DoLiveSteamHeater): Fix up enthalpy to
	account for vent flow, enthalpy contribution wasnt included in
	total
	Check for vent flow > live steam flow
	If feed contains condensate, vent now only takes vapor 
	(EvalProducts): Added "on" check box so heater can be disabled.

	* TTPrecip.cpp (BuildDataFields): Damping factors are now are now "%"
	                (EvalProducts): Add sanity Check to external cooling
			Cooling is now volume flow
			(DoResults): Total solids as well as THA
			(AdjustMasses): Switched on mass damping
			(AdjustSSA): Set SSA either manually or from stream
			(BuildDataFields): Added new damping for external cooling

	* TTPrecip.cpp (EvalLosses): Added separate displays of
	environmental and evap heat losses. 

	* precip.cpp (CPrecip): Put damping into base file precip.h,
	initilize damping to 0.0 in constructor

	* TubeReactor.cpp: 
	TagDB	NdFBS Class Table missing

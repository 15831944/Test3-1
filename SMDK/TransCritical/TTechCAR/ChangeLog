	* CARTubeDigester.cpp (DoLiveSteamHeater): Fix up enthalpy to
	account for vent flow, enthalpy contribution wasnt included in
	total
	Check for vent flow > live steam flow
	If feed contains condensate, vent now only takes vapor 
	(EvalProducts): Added "on" check box so heater can be disabled.

	* TTPrecip.cpp (BuildDataFields): Damping factors are now are now "%"
	                (EvalProducts): Add sanity Check to external cooling
			Cooling is now volume flow
			(DoResults): Total solids as well as THA
			(AdjustMasses): Switched on mass damping
			(AdjustSSA): Set SSA either manually or from stream
			(BuildDataFields): Added new damping for external cooling

	* TTPrecip.cpp (EvalLosses): Added separate displays of
	environmental and evap heat losses. 

	* precip.cpp (CPrecip): Put damping into base file precip.h,
	initilize damping to 0.0 in constructor

	* TubeReactor.cpp: 
	TagDB	NdFBS Class Table missing

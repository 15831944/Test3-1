;;; ST.SHP  -- Surface Texture shape file example.
;;;
;;; These shape definitions can be LOADed into AutoCAD and used to annotate
;;; mechanical part drawings that specify surface texture.  These shapes are
;;; provided as examples of shape definition; no warranty, as to the
;;; appropriateness of the shape definitions for a particular application,
;;; is expressed or implied.  The shape definitions are based on common
;;; drafting practice and do not represent adherence to a specific standard.
;;;
;;; The definitions are constructed using the sub-shape mechanism. The three
;;; classes of use are defined by the sub-shapes "opt" (optional), "obl"
;;; (obligatory), and "pro" (prohibited).  Additional sub-shapes define the
;;; standard machine tool surface lays: "lay-x" (angular in both directions),
;;; "lay-m" (multi-directional), "lay-c" (circular), "lay-r" (radial),
;;; "lay-p" (non-directional; pitted or protuberant), "lay-perp"
;;; (perpendicular), and "lay-parallel".  Sub-shapes are named in lower case
;;; and are not listed by the "?" options of the LOAD and SHAPE commands.
;;;
;;; The ten (10) sub-shape definitions are combined into twenty-one (21)
;;; named shapes, where the name is a combination of the use class and the
;;; lay type, such as "OPT-R" is the symbol for "Optional, radial lay".
;;;
;;; Additional surface texture mark information, such as Waviness Height,
;;; Roughness Values, or Machining Allowance, can then be added to the drawing
;;; using the TEXT or DTEXT commands.

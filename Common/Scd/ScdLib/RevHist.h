3) Fixed new project bug - after selecting a model library, a prompt to create
   the new project was given from the incorrect directory.


7.1 Rev 5.0 : 11 February 1997
------------------------------
1) Implemented SysCAD Security/Licensing functionality. SysCAD can now be protected.
2) Fixed project bugs: (a) If a project is open and another project is loaded or a
   new project is started, and the Cancel button is pressed (in the save old project
   dialog), it did not work correctly (the old project was not unloaded correctly).
   The Cancel button has been removed.  (b) When changing projects, the options,
   project configuration, reports or script commands dialogs were not closed.
   (c) When a project is loaded and a problem with model DLL is found (old style
   project; DLL not found; or wrong version number) a missleading dialog was shown.

   shown when it should not have been.  (d) DoChart(...) for trend reports did not work
   with the correct Time(...) options.  (e) If a requested tag for a trend report did
   not exist in the historian, an error message was not given, junk numbers were returned.
4) Stopped saving full path for all files in reports and command scripts dialogs
   which are in the project path. ie filenames become relative.
5) Improved 'Project Save As Options' dialog to include all file types. It now
   disables all file types that aren't found in the project being saved.
6) Improved project view. It now also contains a tree with most of the files used by
   a project. Can edit some directly, can also see all models that use the same file.
7) When using the browse button to add a report or script file to a list the current
   directory was changed. This can have disasterous results when (for eg) loading
   reactions or pgms. Fixed (current directory is not changed).
8) Can choose text editor (default=notepad.exe) in general options dialog (Other page).
9) Removed ztagobj.* and all references to 'UsingZTagObj'

   (ie windows completely beyond the edges of the main window) are automatically
   moved to ensure they are visible in the main window.
5) When user right clicks on main background window, a pop-up menu is shown.
6) Added 'reconnect tags' option to pop-up menu for trend text windows.

7.1 Rev 5.4 : 6 March 1997
------------------------------
1) Completed merge project functionality.
2) Improved parsing of command script files, specifically the filename parameters for
   all command script functions.
3) When inserting or constructing a unit or link in the graphics, a tag containing a
   dot (.) was accepted as part of the tag name causing errors. This is now prevented.
4) The toolbar buttons for the current or top window which should be active are no
   longer active after performing certain tasks. (eg after saving a project or after
   loading a project) This has been fixed.
5) Fixed bug introduced in Rev 5.0: When editing a new reaction file the extension 'pgm'
   instead of 'rct' was used.
6) While inserting or constructing a unit or link in a graphics window, the user could
   right click to access a model. This caused problems and is now prevented.

Changes in various SysCAD 8.2 Beta versions Build 50 to Build 69 were made
between April 2001 and May 2002. First official release of 8.2 is Build 70.
Beta versions were released selectively. Below is a list of many of the changes/
improvements/fixes/new-features:

General changes and changes in ProBal Mode
------------------------------------------
1.	In ProBal, significant improvements in convergence (eg Tear Blocks) management:
    Improved visibility of errors/damping/tolerances; new access window for viewing/
    setting Tolerances for internal solvers (eg VLE, etc); new count of converged
    iterations; new option to set number of consecutive iterations solver must continue
    "solving" for and remain solved after all tear variables/etc have met convergence
    tolerance requirements, this is done in ProBal Setup - convergence tab page.
2.	All specie data for a project is loaded from syscad.mdb located in the project
    cfgfiles folder. The option to allow loading of specie data from the default.mdb
    has been removed.
3.	The specie models previously referred to as "mass-weighted-mean" and Steam/water
    have been renamed as the "Standard" Specie Model.
4.	Improvements for water and steam properties models. Implemented new method based
    on industrial standards IAPWS-IF97. The H2O model is selected and applied globally.
    The old "Steam/Water Specie model" has been removed. Added an option to use
    "function surfaces" which provides a significant speed improvement for retrieving
    H2O properties from a lookup after they have been calculated once.  The water
    properties are selected from the Plant Model page.
5.	New fields in Plant Model Access window for information. A new option to set the
    state of all units in a project.
6.	Rework solver states to have one set of toolbar buttons regardless of Dynamic/
    ProBal mode. Solver has three states (a) Edit (Stopped); (b) Idle (paused); and
    (c) Run (solving/running). Now need to use project Configure to change from ProBal
    to Dynamic mode. New toolbar button to edit solver options.
7.	Updated Project - Configure dialog box to reflect changes made and new options
    available (solver modes, driver, OPC, historian, etc).
8.	Updated ProBal Setup and Dynamic Setup dialog boxes to reflect recent changes.

    check-boxes); new option to "send" the selected tag to the next available space
    in the trend window most recently selected; improved right-click pop-up menus;
    support of mouse wheel to change value of currently selected field up or down;
    new buttons to right of fields in access window which contain tags that refer
    to other units/pipes to allow quick access to these units data and/or graphics;
    restore cursor to correct field after pressing OK/Refresh/etc.
11.	Improved display as seen in Access window for most unit models (consistency,
    defaults, hidden/shown, units, etc). The most significant changes/improvements
    in the separation models (filters, etc).
12.	In general options, updated Graphics Symbols Displaying Colours options, where
    line style as well as colour can now be selected.

    multiple quick view windows, and multiple columns for different tags in a quick
    view. Also an option to "trend" selected values as bar graphs in a quick view.
    Explained under the Mouse Click on Graphics Symbols section.
15.	For Save Snapshot and scenarios a new zip option is available, where the snp or
    scn files are automatically zipped and unzipped significantly reducing disk usage.
16.	Improvements to Message window to allow copy to clipboard of messages via right
    click pop up menu.
17.	As part of a project save, all "external" referenced files are "backed up" into
    a zip file called RmtFilesBackup.zip. The previous "composite" backup file is no
    longer used.

    data, etc. Improvements to scale, fit, range, etc trend lines from right-click pop
    up menus.
20.	Significant improvements in "Change Stats" which can be used to display the tags
    that have the largest errors, most changes and worst oscillations. These largest
    changes and oscillations are also shown in each model and pipe if the "collect
    stats" is switched on.
21.	Improved ProBal Solver progress dialog box, including new right click pup-up menu
    to access problem tags.
22.	New Select Window functionality where a small window, which is always visible,

5) Improvements to client models: (a) Improved QAL Precip PSD model.


Build 73 : 30 October 2002
------------------------------
1) Implemented a new Steam Turbine model (ProBal in heatxch1.dll).
2) Implemented a new Falling Film Evaporator model (ProBal in heatxch1.dll).
3) Implemented new Simple Heater model for single input, single ouput similar
   to EHX in a pipe. (ProBal in heatxch1.dll)
4) Implemented new ProBal functionality and access window for a valve.
5) Implemented new ProBal functionality and access window for a pump.
6) Implemented new ProBal functionality and access window for a reducer. In
   ProBal it is identical to a valve.
7) Additional display fields in Contact Heater. Fixed to use correct pressure
   which includes BPE when this is present.
8) Changed ASat (Aeq) to use concentration parameters at 25dC instead of at T.
9) When using VLE (Vapour Liquid Equilibrium) in a feeder, for the option
   "SuperHeat_Vap", SysCAD now forces feed to vapour. Similarily, when using
   the option "SubCooled_Liq", SysCAD now forces feed to liquid.
10) Improvements in size-distribution functionality. Improved use of multiple
    species with size data, removed unused display column types for size data.
11) For Bayer properties, included new options when using the define liquor
    calculator to define organics/TOC.
12) Fix in Shell&Tube heater where if in condensing mode and liquid was present
    in feed, the Shell&Tube produced a mass error by discarding all vapours.
13) New option when drawing links, to draw a default link/pipe line based on
    selection method. User may override by continuing to draw links manually
    in usual manner.
14) Other various minor improvements.
15) Improved client models: (a) Alcan ASat calculation; (b) QAL Precip model,
    extra QAL bayer precip values, and Alpart ASat calculation.



Build 74 : 19 December 2002
------------------------------
1) For each unit in flowsheet network, control actions now ordered separately
   to the flow order. (ie separate networks for order of evaluation).  New
   option to chose to apply control actions at start or end of an iteration.
   New window to display order of evaluation of flows or controls.
2) New option to allow PGM (general controller) to apply at startup (before
   first iteration) and to apply at end (after last iteration). Use the
   new special flags "OnInitialise" and "OnTerminate" in the PGM code. The
   OnInitialise is especially useful for setting tags before the solve starts
   (ie change tags that cannot be set while solving). SetDynTag must be used.
3) New option in PID to enable tracking when controller is changed between
   manual and auto. (ie make setpoint=measured when in manual)
4) Implemented a new Desuperheater model (ProBal in heatxch1.dll).
5) Implemented a new Boiler model (ProBal in heatxch1.dll).
6) Improvements to new simple heater model, including heater sizing calculations.
7) Improvements in the pump model (ProBal) to ensure it has correct isentropic
   behaviour. Added display field for work. A pump can be used as a compressor
   for vapour streams. The pump is a constant entropy unit, while the valve is
   a constant enthalpy unit, both have a pressure change.
8) In dynamic, new actuator and transmitter models.
9) Fix in dynamic for overflows (density/composition error).
10) Reaction convergence fix and improvements for FEM reactions.
11) When using define liquor calculator in a feeder using Bayer properties
    model, SysCAD automatically changes the feed view option to Mass Fraction.
12) Added underflow solids recovery display field to classifier and thickener.
13) Fixed a crash loading graphics drawing under certain conditions.
14) In access window new right click pupup menu option to "copy tag" which
    only copies the portion after the unit tag (eg "Qi.Vf"). This is useful
    when copying tags to build Excel reports.
15) In dynamic implemented a new regulator function block. This is applied at
    pumps and valves and prevents low or negative pressures ie flow is "self
    regulating". This provides a significant level of stability for network
    under low flow, low pressure and/or reverse flow conditions.
16) Changes to SysCAD OPC Client to allow operation on separate thread or on
    the main thread.
17) Significant changes to size-distribution functionality: Re-arranged
    configuration dialog to enter sieve series data separately to size
    distribution definitions. SysCAD now supports multiple distributions in
    the same project. Implemented a new size distribution change model to
    allow conversion from one distribution to another using a different sieve
    series. Changed the behaviour for defining a distribution. Once the size
    distribution quality is switched on (create), then one distribution
    definition is automatically used. Only one can be used at a time in any
    model or pipe. Changed the taging for size data to use "Sz" rather than
    the distribution name. Various other size distribution related improvements.
18) Upgraded to use CrypKey 5.7
19) Various other minor improvements.

Update 1 : 16 January 2003
------------------------------
1) Implemented new cooling tower methods.
2) Added new tags in IO section InCnt and OutCnt which is number of input and
   output streams from a unit.

Update 2 : 23 January 2003
------------------------------
1) Implemented new CP equation for use in Specie Database. The format is
   Poly_Cp(a,b,c,d) where Cp = a + bT + cT^2 + dT^3.
2) Fix in feeder where under certain conditions a quality could not be switched off.
   Qualities are now removed from pipes when flowsheet Initialise or Empty is selected.
3) Some driver improvements in OPC client. New option in trend page right click popup
   menu to copy driver tag address to clipboard.
4) Turbine model state did not recover correctly after a project solve, save and reload.


Build 75 : 6 March 2003
------------------------------
1) Enabled new Free Energy Minimisation (FEM) option in reaction blocks. FEM uses
   VCS (Villars-Cruise-Smith) algorithm.
2) First implementation of new BlackBox models that are used in conjunction with
   the new "SysCAD Model Developers Kit" (ScdMDK). Beta version!
3) Driver improvements: (a) Improvements for OPC client startup.  (b) The only valid
   driver IO types are now ro, wo or rw. (removed option 'r' and 'w').  (c) Improved
   testing and validation of tags in get/set connections.  (d) improved message
   display for driver load information and errors.  (e) Fixed an error where for
   a 'wo' tag SysCAD received an "unexpected" value from OPC server, SysCAD now logs
   the error and sends back its 'correct' version of the tag.
4) New option in Simple Heater to specify an external tag from which the required
   duty is retrieved.
5) Added meaningful error message to Disk Centrifuge when vapour is in feed.
6) Fixed a project recover in solved state problem for sinks configured as
   "source constant pressure" for ProBal.
7) Improvements for numerical stability for convergence and solve state start/stop for
   ProBal for certain conditions. (Range in max damping).
8) Fixed a large memory loss error introduced in Build74 in order of evaluation for
   controls where a PID referred to another PID in the same unit.
9) Fixed an error introduced in Build74 where a SetDynTag in a PGM did not get
   set under certain circumstances.
9) Significant improvement in time to displaying Access window in large projects.
10) Extended Tag Cross Reference functionality for display of triangles in Access
    window fields. Blue for sets, green for gets.
11) Added new display tags in Alumina species properties page for precipitation
    information 'A/C_Saturation' and 'SSN_Ratio'.
12) Removed list of individual windows in window list menu which did not work
    correctly for projects with more than nine windows.
13) When using "Copy..." to create a new configuration file based on a selection,
    the specie database is now copied from the original.
14) Improved error messages and functionality when using construct link or construct
    unit in graphics and a "configured" graphic symbol is selected.
15) After project load, etc list number of invalid tags in a trend window rather
    then report a separate message for each illegal tag in a trend.
16) Fixed a crash caused by very long message strings sent to the message window.
17) Fixed a crash in specie database import fuctionality.

Update 1 : 19 March 2003
------------------------------
1) Fix for bug introduced in Build75 where under certain conditions referenced tags
   were not refreshed. (eg certain measured tags in a PID). Fix for General Controler
   using gettag(...) to refer to a tag within itself.
2) Fix for "composition fetch" in feeders where the pressure value was not transferred.
3) Changed ProBal pressure behaviour in a sink, the pipe outlet pressure going to a
   sink that is not connected no longer takes the value from the sink P_Rqd.
4) Made general information fields visible in the PlantModel access window on the
   statistics tab page. These were mistakenly hidden.
5) Fixed error where extra buttons and checkboxes appear in access window and never
   get deleted. These are typically from a general controller.
6) Fixed a crash during a PGM load if there is a misplaced "return". Fixed a PGM crash
   caused by suplying an empty string to the lognote command. eg LogNote("")

Update 2 : 28 March 2003
------------------------------
1) Improvements to SMDK ("SysCAD Model Developers Kit"): User can now use cfg file
   to list custom user SMDK DLL files that must be loaded. Vector of "volumetric
   flow" and "normalised volumetric flow" are now provided as well as the mass
   flow vector. Added function to set heat flow for energy balance. Other minor
   improvements as well as enhancements in examples and code documentation.
2) Fixed display of correct size data in crusher and screen models in project using
   multiple sieve series.

Update 3 : 17 April 2003
------------------------------
1) Fix to ensure QFeed tab page in access window in units such as thickener is
   created after a project load rather than when solve is selected.
2) Fix to recover correct organics, TOC and oxalate data in Bayer feed calculator
   after a project load.
3) Fix to correctly transfer SAM data in bayer model. Note that Al2O3.3H2O(s) (THA)
   must be present in stream for correct transfer of SAM data. To override SAM or D
   in a pipe "SetSAM" must be checked otherwise data entered for SAM or D is ignored.
4) Fixed use of reaction extent in dynamic. Note that this should only be used
   in non-surge units such as pipes.
5) Other minor improvements.

Update 4 : 23 May 2003
------------------------------
1) Various changes and enhancements to SMDK, including implementation of DevLic.
2) Ensure correct sieve definition is used in displays for screen and crusher models.
3) Improved reporting when loading PGM for errors caused by misuse of commands
   'return' and 'endfunct'.
4) Fixed problem where the first time 'SetDynTag' is used in a PGM, it was not set.
5) Fix in Bayer feed calculator for occasional crash caused by zero organics or TOC.
6) Changed default definition of Normal Pressure from 101.31 to 101.325. Added these
   as display fields in PlantModel access window.
7) Improved client models: Significant changes to QAL Precip PB model.
   New KaiserAl Precip model.


Build 76 : 29 May 2003
------------------------------
1) Implemented a change which affects values for Volumetric Flows for vapours.
   This affects the feeder in "Source_ConstQv" and "Source_ConstNQv" modes and
   pipe displays Qi and Qo for view "VolFlow", "VolFrac", "NormVolFlow" and
   "NormVolFrac". The change is for the density used when displaying Volumetric
   flowrates and Normalised Volumetric flowrates for vapours.  The calculation
   Volume = mass/density is used. Previously the density values entered in the
   species database were used, now the Ideal gas law PV = nRT is used instead.
   Both options are still available, primarily for backward compatability of
   projects. A constant or the equations 'LinearGasDensity' or 'IdealGasDensity'
   can be entered in the specie database. This can be ignored and forced to
   'IdealGasDensity' in the edit configuration dialog for the 'Species' tab page,
   where for each gas there is a check box to select 'Ideal Formulation'.
2) Fix for crash for invalid steam feed to desuperheater.
3) Fix for crash in project load after removing species from configuration that
   were used in size distribution.

Update 1 : 24 June 2003
------------------------------
1) Added option under menu "Options|General" on "Mouse" tab page to enable/disable
   the mouse wheel action for changing selected field value in access or trend windows.
2) Change to graphic display of sizedistribution graphs to use minimum and maximum
   display values entered by user.
3) Fix in partion curve display (eg screen models) of size data fields which occured
   under certain conditions in projects mith multiple sieve definitions.
4) Added option to switch individual reactions in a reaction block on and off.
5) Changed the options on the tab page "Models" in the "Project View".

Update 2 : 25 July 2003
------------------------------
1) Fix for bug introduced in Build76 Update1 for Bayer feed calculator for setting
   TOC, Organics, etc.


Build 77 : 4 August 2003
------------------------------
1) Improved display fields for precipitation model.
2) Fix for a crash in the belt filter model for "bad" data points in the washing
   curve.
3) First draft of new Excel report type "General Tag Information". This places
   general flowsheet tag information and lists on an Excel worksheet with the
   name 'Tag Info'.  To generate, in the SysCAD Reports tab page, add a new report
   of type 'General Information' (the report name field is not used), then press
   the 'Generate' button in the normal way.
4) Moved SysCAD OPC Server functionality into the DLL scOPCsrv. Added Browse OPC
   tag functionality to SysCAD.
5) Added new EHX method TempDrop where a pipe temperature drop can be specified.
6) For ProBal force operating pressure of most separation and similar units to
   standard pressure (101.325).
7) Other minor improvements. Fix for crash in cooling tower with zero feed. Fix
   for crash in heatexchanger for 'invalid' Bayer feed.

Update 1 : 19 August 2003
------------------------------
1) For the model configuration dialog, implemented various improvements mostly
   related to selecting the required model DLL files. Implemented option to
   select required SMDK DLL files.
2) Improvements to recovery of a project that under certain conditions was not
   recovered in a converged state. Improved recovery of tear streams and precip
   model.
3) Fixed crash from user entering a 0Kelvin temperature in specie database.

Update 2 : 28 August 2003
------------------------------
1) Fixed error where PGM OnInitialise block was used to switch PID controllers
   on or off and this change was not aplied until second SysCAD solve.
2) Enhancements to the new SysCAD Excel General Information report.

Update 3 : 6 October 2003
------------------------------
1) Fix for correct recovery after project load of byte type PGM variables.
   These were incorrectly always loaded as 0 or 255.
2) Fix for DXF block naming in SysCAD that causes a dxf drawing to not be loaded
   in AutoCAD or other CAD package.
3) Added additional display fields in AluminaProperties page for (1) Na2O
   equivilant fields; (2) actual concentrations of selected species.
4) Removed ScandrettEfficiency display in Drum Filter and replaced it with
   WashEfficiency (ConcFeed - ConcCake)/(ConcFeed - ConcWash)

Update 4 : 29 October 2003
------------------------------
1) Some minor improvements: Fix for crash in OxalateEquilibrium equation. Improvement
   for project recovery where PID or PGM refer to unsaved calculated tags.
2) Fix for remembering the correct default SpecieModel in edit configuration.
3) Fix for recovering converged project after snapshot or scenario load.
4) Improvements for ProBal Darcy pressure drop calculation. Limit pressure drop
   to ensure outlet pressure is not less than 10kPa. Added new calculated fields
   such as velocity and pressure drop. Added warning message when calculated
   velocity exceeds "reasonable" maximum. Added option to set friction factor
   rather than calculate it from viscosity and roughness. The Darcy equation
   now determines if it is a vapour stream and uses a different equation for
   a compressable gas. In the past the slurry incompresible pressure drop
   calculation was always used.


Update 5 : 17 November 2003
------------------------------
1) Fix for temporary freeze when ploting log scale graphs for XY functions with
   'bad' data points.
2) Improvements to "Solvent Extraction Mixer Settler" model using Isotherm method.
3) Corrected the Alumina properties fields added in update 3 from Na20 to Na2O.
4) Fixed crash where "orphan" pipes from a tank/tie/unit are connected to a sink.
5) Fix for annotation blocks on a drawing that were lost for a change tag.
6) Fix where if a controller refered to the tag PlantModel.Stats.WorstErr or
   similar it always returned 0.

Update 6 : 1 December 2003
------------------------------
1) Added OxalateEquilibrium field in Bayer Properties model.
2) Updated WashEfficiency calculation (removed ) in Filter Press, Centrifugal
   Filter and Drum Filter. CompWashEff = (ConcFeed - ConcCake)/(ConcFeed - ConcWash)
3) Extended Cyclone model to include additional correction factors.

Update 7 : 20 December 2003
------------------------------
1) Added new Cp equation "Shomate_Cp(A,B,C,D,E)" of the form Cp=A + Bt + Ct^2 + Dt^3 + E/t^2
   where t = temperature(in Kelvin) / 1000.
2) Fix for a crash for ProBal solve after pipes conected to units are deleted but the unit
   itself is not deleted.

=============================================================================
================                SysCAD 9.0                   ================
=============================================================================
Beta version Build 100 to 109
First official release Build 110

Build 113 : 2 December 2004
------------------------------
1) Implemented new Audit section for all models. This is visible on the last
   tab page of all models, with many values only being calculated after a
   solve. This is useful checking the mass and energy balance of a unit.
   You can select the popup menu option to copy to the clipboard a report
   that can be pasted in Excel for analysis.
2) Restructured graphics symbols to belong to groups, where many models may
   belong to the same group for the purpose of selecting symbols. Graphics
   dxf symbols for these groups restructured into separate folders in the
   basefiles\symbols folder.
3) Implemented a range of significant changes and improvements for the insert
   unit command.
4) Implemented a new command to change the graphics symbol for a unit.
5) Implemented new PID option "Clarke FF" which includes a bias and feed forward
   tag option.
6) For a PID if an Integral value of zero is entered, SysCAD actualy uses a value
   equal to half the period (step size). For ProBal this is 0.5 because the
   iteration "time" is 1.0. This value is now changed during solve, this does
   not apply to the new ClarkeFeedForward option where an integral value of
   zero is allowed.
7) Excel trend reports: Implemented new Excel Trend Query option that returns
   the value at the end of a time slice; added new time column reporting options;
   improved feedback for incorrect query time inputs.
8) Improved ProBal pipe Darcy pressure drop options.
9) Added functionality to load a default file for pgm and reaction files.
10) Various improvements to SetTagList model, including option to allow tags
   to be set before the first iteration.
11) Added option to select which 'bin' in a multistorage unit is visible.
12) Implemented new EHX method for loss to ambient.
13) Changed CCD to allow it to operate in dynamic transfer mode.
14) Fix in Mixer Settler for isotherm method for invalid specie selection.
15) Fixed some crashes for PSD display that occur for large amounts of data.
16) Added a new string input field "Location" as part of the standard header
    of all models.
17) Added detailed display and breakdown of various solver timers for tasks
    and threads mainly for analysis and debug purposes in the plant model window.
18) Re-enabled solver multithread options in solver. Error was in controls section
    of multithreaded solver.
19) Some improvements in functionality and reporting for setting of tags from other
    models (eg PGM, PID, profile, etc), especially for setting a tag that is a "button".
20) Improved load time of models with large lists for profiles, events, taglists, etc.
21) Fixed a crash if attempting to store strings in the historian.
22) Removed the option to hide/display a field in the access window by left double click.
23) Added option to select the fill colour for graphics for dynamic annotation
24) Other minor changes including: various improvements in the COM interface; improvements
    in electrical models; improvements in "neutral database" model & graphics import/export
    functionality; begun implementing beta version of group template creation and insert
    (not enabled in released version).

Build 114 : 11 February 2005
------------------------------
1) (#94,#95) Added display for Kinetic Viscosity, Thermal Viscosity, Thermal Conductivity,
   Prandtl number and SurfaceTension. Defaults for these properties are values for water.
2) (#122,#115) In Bayer properties: increased tolerance for internal density calculation
   convergence (this was essential for correct results in reactions using finalconc method
   for Bayer streams);  added display of BoilPtElav; fixed display of LVolume and SLVolume
   for empty stream.
3) In tear streams, added a new option for a manual tear to set initial conditions.
   Various options for how, when and what is being set.
4) Added option in feeder composition fetch to selectively transfer qualities.
5) Reporting of PGM errors now includes iteration number.
6) Improved layout and included new fields in Barometric Condensor and Flash Tank.
7) (#116) Fix for tank inline level control for certain arrangements of multiple outlet pipes.
8) Removed error messages that were reported by reactions where no reaction occurred.
9) Improved functionality and new fields in electrical cable and incomer.
10) Improved data entry dialog for PSD measurements in project configuration.
11) Fixed save and recover for NAN or '*' values.
12) For opening project, etc changed starting folder from cfgfiles to a level below.
13) Changed default naming of new graphics pages.
14) Added Excel trend report options TimeDate and TimeFull.
15) Fixed problem where after starting SysCAD and loading a project, for the first
    dynamic solve, SysCAD appears to solve for one extra, 1 second, iteration!
16) (#139) Fixed problem where if the required simulation time is set ($Dyn.DynStats.RqdTm)
    SysCAD usually solves for one extra iteration.
17) (#134) Improvements to model/graphics import/export and group definition, save and
    insert. This is still beta version functionality.
18) (#145) Fix for a crash when loading a profile with an invalid NAN time value or for
    an empty row entry.
19) (#142) In dynamic transfer mode where the pipe flow is restricted and that pipe is
    an outlet from a tie, the tie did not output the correct flow to that pipe. It
    now sets the correct flow and the pipe reports the error and manages the spill.

Update 1 : 15 February 2005
------------------------------
1) (#130) Fixed a number of bugs in the setting of the mass flow of a feeder when the view
   is "MassFlow". Importantly this fixes a save and recover bug introduced in Build114.

Update 2 : 18 February 2005
------------------------------
1) (#130) Additional fixes for feeder save & recover from update 1.
2) (#144) Fixed an error in profile load where input file contained whitespace.
3) Fixed error introduced in Build114 where value for Integral in PID was forced to 30.
4) Fixed an error for mixing of streams where one stream uses SMDK Bayer properties
   and was pure water or steam.
5) (#128,#132) Prevent user from entering a negative mass for a specie for contents of a tank.
   Assume 0.0 if entry is negative.
6) Some tidy ups of options in new manual tear feature.

Update 3 : 22 February 2005
------------------------------
1) (#151) Added new Matrix class to the PGM. Similar to the existing Array class.
2) Fixed an error in PGM where a solve start failed because of a previous
   reference to a tag that is no longer valid using the SetDynTag or GetDynTag.
3) Fix for checkbox fields in models developed using SMDK. The correct values were
   not being set or retrieved from trend or PGM code.

Update 4 : 1 March 2005
------------------------------
1) (#149,#153) Implemented new option in reactions in tanks for dynamic mode. A
   reaction rate (fraction per second) must be specified for the Extent:Fraction
   method. eg "Extent:Fraction FeS2(s) Rate = 0.0001"
2) (#160) Fixed crash where after deleting models that had tag references (eg PID)
   to existing models, in some circumstances SysCAD crashed on solve.
3) (#120) The insert symbol for the graphics commands, did not remember the most
   recently used symbols. Fixed.
4) (#114) Fixed problem where for the change symbol graphics command, if selecting
   alternative symbols, the original scale was not retained.
5) (#133) Added a string option in SMDK for units.
6) In SMDK Bayer properties example, removed calculator options for organics, and
   implemented simple TOC & Oxalate concentration option.
7) Added FreeCaustic term in Bayer properties model.
8) (#150) Allow use of attributes in calculations in specie configuration.
9) (#124) Display correct values for Cp in audit page, was always 0.

Update 5 : 2 March 2005
------------------------------
1) (#164) When loading a reaction with a specified heat of reaction, SysCAD did
   not recognise the separator '/' resulting in the specie not being recognised
   and a value of 0 being used. This has been fixed so the following example now
   works: "HeatOfReaction: msFixed = -125/Na2CO3(l)". Note that old projects
   loaded in this update would result in different reaction output conditions
   if reactions included this.
2) Fixed a multithread solver crash for dual CPU PC.
3) (#166) Fixed a crash for a PGM reference to an object eg GetTag("P_1").
4) (#150) Fixed an attribute save and recover problem. Added on optional
   specification of min and max range for attributes. (Note that currently
   calculations and attributes can only be specified manualy in the cfg file)
5) Stricter checking and reporting of invalid conversion units in PGM has been
   implemented.

Update 6 : 9 March 2005
------------------------------
1) Various reaction FinalConc fixes and improvements: (#161) When using FinalConc
   in a reaction, there is now an option to specify at what temperature this is
   at. eg "Extent: FinalConc Al2O3(l) = 85 At 25";  (#180) Fixed an error where
   a forward only reaction '->' actualy occured in the reverse direction;
   (#174) Fixed an error where for simultaneous reactions using mixed extent
   fraction and extent finalconc methods, the incorrect result for the finalconc
   portion was achieved;  (#174) The FinalConc method only aplies to the
   concentration after that reaction step in a sequence of reactions. To make this
   more apparant, the tag Conc_Act has been replaced with Conc_EOStep (concentration
   at end of reaction step) and Conc_Final (concentration at end of ALL reactions).
2) (#173) Fixed an error in reactions where a specie occurs as both a reactant
   and a product in the same reaction.
3) (#172) Fixed an error recently introduced where the composition fetch
   transferred the incorrect mass flow.
4) For dynamic, added an option "TrackMinMaxMeas" and "TrackMinMaxOut" to PID
   that, if unchecked, will not show the warnings for the measured or output
   values being out of range.
5) (#179) Fixed a memory leak related to PGM or PID tag references. This problem
   was particularly relevant to dynamic projects.
6) Fixed an error where PGM or PID tag reference lists were unnecessarily
   continuously being rebuilt. This fix results in a significant speed
   improvement, especially in dynamic models.

Update 7 : 12 March 2005
------------------------------
1) In extended unit conversion lists such as those used in reactions the SI unit
   (eg "kg/s" as well as "kg/s.H2O(l)") was not added to the list of available
   conversions (eg for tag xx.RB.R1.msXfer).
2) (#188) Fixed an error introduced in Update 5 where in a feeder in View "MassFrac"
   with Basis "Phase" any data entry was interpreted incorrectly.
3) (#192) Added an option in SMDK to allow visibility of a MStream object.
4) Some minor improvements in the Audit report.
5) (#172) Further improvements and fixes to composition fetch options.
6) Further changes to dynamic reaction rate option first implemented in Update4.
   By example, the two reaction rate options for reactions in tanks for dynamic mode
   are:"Extent:Fraction FeS2(s) Rate = 0.0001" and "Extent:Fraction FeS2(s) Rate =
   0.0001 Stabilised". The first option uses the Rate directly and the fraction
   reacted is given by: Fraction = Rate*DeltaTime. The second with the keyword
   Stabilised is a 1st order response and the fraction reacted is given by:
   Fraction = 1  exp(-Rate*DeltaTime).

Update 8 : 29 April 2005
------------------------------
1) (#188) Additional corrections to those in update 7 for data entry in a feeder
   in View "MassFrac" with Basis "Individual Phase" where data entry was interpreted
   incorrectly.
2) (#147), (#196) For dynamic transfer mode, under certain conditions a tank or
   connected feeder incorrectly reported an output flowrate when it should be
   zero based on configuration.
3) (#203) Fixed problem where the thermal loss action in the precip model did not
   occur if SSA in feed was not present.
4) (#213) Fixed error in GM in tie for Phase_MassFrac option with PhaseSpec
   Individual where no solids are present in the feed.
5) (#199) Fixed the graphics "Construct Tie" command which did not work from
   Build 113.
6) In dynamic, relax tolerance for reporting spills. Improved spill messages.
7) Added a new function "Setup" for the PGM class Noise. This is the same as
   Init, but doesn't set the seed value. Setup(mean, stddev, typ, global).
8) Fixed crash for setting historian tag list from COM interface.

Update 9 : 8 May 2005
------------------------------
1) (#242) Added tripper functionality to the conveyor belt model where a single
   drive with position logic can represent the tripper movement and feed separate
   individual bins based on position.
2) (#195) Removed functionality that changed toolbars for a runtime license.
3) Fixed error in PGM and RCT where you could not edit the file if it was in
   the CfgFiles folder.
4) Fixed an error for externally setting specie fractions in phase view in a feeder.

Update 10 : 24 May 2005
------------------------------
1) (#237) For SMDK, the state of a MStream class included in a unit is now saved
   and recovered correctly.
2) For SMDK, added some extra virtual functions to the MBayer class.
3) (#252) Fixed bug where the tag "PlantModel.Stats.WorstErr" always returned 0.
4) (#240) Fixed bug where the SetTagList model, did not set any $Dyn or $PB tags.
5) (#246) Fixed error where from the COM interface, the historian was not deleted.
6) (#248) Disabled multi-threading solver control actions which caused a freeze on
   dual CPU or HT PC. To be fixed in future release.
7) (#197) Fix for tie where incorrect outlet temperature is predicted where GM
   model is off and Qm_MakeUp mode functionality is used.

Update 11 : 7 June 2005
------------------------------
1) SMDK: Added Time and DeltaTime functions to MMethod class.
2) Fix for Excel Trend report crash for large number of tags.
3) (#263) Further fixes for conveyor belt mass balance errors.
4) Fix for crash that occurred if project is saved immediately after adding a new
   reaction file.
5) Improved error message reporting for unbalanced reactions.
6) (#159) Implemented new washer model option where the bypass can be directed
   to the underflow rather than the overflow.
7) (#267) Fix for reaction FinalConc method where a specie source is included.
8) (#259) Fix for error where referenced file for SetTagList, Profile or Events
   model was not copied for a project save-version or save-as.
9) (#271), (#129) Fix for freeze during construct unit or link if an invalid
   tag is used.
10) (#198) Fix for crash during construct link where invalid model is selected
    for source or destination unit.

1) (#54) Found and fixed an error in reactions where the feed is a Bayer stream.
   Where the heat of reaction (HOR) override is used an incorrect temperature
   for reaction output was predicted. Also, where the stream is a Bayer stream
   and HOR was not provided, again the incorrect temperature is calculated.
   Both issues were related to the fact that SysCAD was incorrectly using the
   "standard" specie model instead of the "bayer" specie model for
   calculating the Heat Of Reaction and/or the change in Total Enthalpy.
   IMPORTANT NOTE: Old projects loaded in this Build could result in different
   reaction output conditions in circumstances described above.

Build 115 : 14 July 2005
------------------------------
1) (#54) Various improvements and changes in reactions. For a Bayer stream, the
   reaction, by default, now uses the Bayer properties (rather than the "standard"
   specie model) as the reference model for internal heat of reaction (HOR)
   calculations. The new option "StdRefModel" can be checked to force the use of
   the "standard" model. IMPORTANT NOTE: Depending on reactions and reaction
   configuration, old projects loaded in this Build could result in different 
   reaction output conditions.
2) (#208) Added an option in reactions where a reference temperature and pressure
   for HOR can be specified. The pressure is separated by a , and is optional.
   (eg HeatOfReaction : msFixed = -897.87 / NiS(s) At 25,101.325) If reference 
   temperature is not specified then reaction feed temperature (and pressure) 
   is assumed (this is behaviour in previous versions). Other valid
   options for specifying HOR temperature and pressure are "Feed", "Prod" and 
   "Std" (eg "HeatOfReaction: msFixed = -125/Na2CO3(l) At Feed")
3) In reactions added a new option "ExtraInfo" which can be used to remove a 
   number of tags previously shown in reactions.
4) Further improvements in the Audit report, especially in terms of reaction
   energy balances.
5) (#178) Implemented functionality where blocks of tags that are of no interest
   in your project can be globaly removed. Because these tags don't exist, they 
   are not visible and the access windows are shorter and neater without the 
   unwanted data. The other important benefit if this is a significantly improved
   speed performance for tag access (eg PGM and PID tag references, etc). This
   functionality also allows user to configure what views for specie lists are 
   available.
6) Changed layout of RB, EHX and VLE in terms of the check boxes and sequence of 
   tab pages (each always on their own page) to be consistent in all models. Note 
   that if RB and EHX are both present, that EHX occurs after reactions.
7) (#183) Added ability to allow EHX in a tie model (Dynamic and ProBal). Added 
   ability to allow EHX in a tank model in ProBal mode.
8) In the pipe model, you can select the sequence of action for RB and EHX.
   Historically the sequence was EHX then RB, the default for new projects will
   now be RB then EHX.
9) (#176) Most fields that may accept a '*' (NAN) as a valid data entry now have
   a dropdown list display with a short description of what '*' represents. For 
   data entry, a '*' is still a valid input as well as the string or index value.
10) (#189) All Bayer specie model feed calculators now operate correctly if vapours
    or other liquids are included in the makeup.
11) Improvements in reporting pipe spills in dynamic transfer mode.
12) Added option "PlantModel.SpillReporting" that determines behaviour when a unit
    or pipe spills. A usefull option for "debugging" spills is where SysCAD goes to
    idle mode (pauses) when a spill occurs so that you can review the cause of the
    problem.
13) The option "PlantModel.ClosureTests" has been extended similar to the new 
    PlantModel.SpillReporting option. Generally this would be off, but can be 
    switched on for checking mass and energy balance (closure) tests in models
    each iteration.
14) Added option "PlantModel.RandomSeedAtStart" which can be used to seed the
    random number generator at the start of a simulation run. Use "*" to use a
    random seed.
15) In the dyanmic setup dialog, improved method for setting real time, iteration 
    time and step size.
16) (#251) For dynamic mode, implemented an option where the start time can be set at 
    startup, as well as restarting the historian.
17) Improved status bar displays of progress for ProBal and Dynamic solve.
18) (#272) Implemented a new option in insert link and redraw link to leave a break in the
    line. This can be done by holding down the Ctrl key while selecting a point or
    by first selecting the new 'Break' button. Changed the 'Orthogonal' and 'Free'
    drawing mode buttons.
19) (#273) Implemented a new option in insert link and redraw link to select an 
    'arrow drawing rule'.
20) (#273) Improved redraw link to operate similar to insert link.
21) (#279) Fix for moving "dumb" graphics line segment.
22) (#274) Implemented a new option to insert or update text on the graphics pages.
23) (#262) Improvement and clarity in options for setting values for a manual tear.
24) (#214) Do not allow historian 'stop gap' to be very small as this prevents correct
    storage of start and stop values in historian.
25) (#214) For the historian equally spaced average values Trend report, the first 
    data points returned at time 'zero' are the current values at that time, all 
    subsequent points are average values for preceeding time interval.
26) Added a new optional field "MolecularDiam" to the specie database. The optional
    fields are "MolecularDiam", "MolarVol" and "CpCv". If this data is entered it may
    accessed by specialised custom or SMDK models.
27) (#286) In reactions implemented new option "ChangeVars" (similar to ExtraInfo)
    that includes tags for each reaction for the change on a mass or mole basis of
    individual species.
28) (#293) Added test for temperature cross-over for "loss to ambient" methods in
    EHX used in units (eg tanks, ties).
29) Shell&Tube Heat exchanger changes: Added new field "UALMTD" which is the 
    theoretical duty which is not always equal to the actual duty. Added new
    field "ThearArea" which displays the theoretical area required based on HTC,
    actual LMTD and duty. If not in fully condensing mode, there is now an option
    to specify "ApproachDT".
30) For shell&tube in condensing mode, added a new option to set the fraction of
    non-condensable gases to be vented. Added new field to display how much 
    steam is actually condensed. (#249) Error message is now provided when there is
    steam present in the condensate outlet stream. Fixed problem where too much 
    steam was condensed (this occurred where duty was higher than maximum available
    duty defined by U*A*LMTD). For backward compatibility, added option "IgnoreAreaLimit"
    which allows extra steam to be condensed.

Update 1 : 3 August 2005
------------------------------
1) (#158) In SMDK added option to SetDefaultTag to include/exclude the Usr prefix.
2) Fix for crash during program exit under certain conditions.
3) PGM enhancements: Added variable PauseSimulation which can be used to put SysCAD 
   into Idle mode (ie paused). Added function strcat4 and strcat5 which can be used 
   to combine 5 and 6 string or Str parameters respectively. Fixed a PGM crash that 
   occured under certain conditions when referencing parameters of nested classes.

Update 2 : 15 August 2005
------------------------------
1) (#319) In the PGM for the Array or Matrix classes, you can now watch the variables
   corresponding to the contents of the array or matrix. To do this use the watch 
   command. If the index is out of range for the array dimensions then the value 
   returned is always NAN ('*') and a set value is ignored. Examples for an 
   individual element in an array are "Watch A[2]" or "Watch A@[2]" for a read-only 
   tag. An example for a range is "Watch A[All,5]" which would show the first 5
   elements of the array. Examples for an individual element in a matrix are 
   "Watch M[2,1]" or "Watch M@[0,0]" for a read-only tag. An example for a range 
   is "Watch M[All,4,2]".
2) In a PGM, when declaring a variable that should be visible as a read-only tag,
   the '*' is now optional. So instead of "double d*@", "double d@" can be used.
3) (#323) The blowdown connection to the boiler is now optional. If a pipe is
   not connected to the blowdown connection, the specified blowdown fraction is
   ignored (ie assumed zero).
4) (#328) Fixed bug in turbine, where the losses due to mechanical efficiency were
   included in the calculation for determining turbine exit conditions. This has
   been fixed and only the adiabatic efficiency is used. Added new output fields
   "TurbineWork" and "TurbinePower" which are the results before applying losses
   for any form of mechanical efficiency. The fields "Work" and "Power" are the 
   final useful output power or work.
   IMPORTANT NOTE: Any projects using the turbine with a MechEfficiency less than
   100% will now predict different outlet conditions for the turbine.
5) (#220) The flash tank model has been updated to work in dynamic transfer mode
   with same behaviour as ProBal mode.
6) (#324) The shell&tube model has been updated to work in dynamic transfer
   mode with same behaviour as ProBal mode.
7) The VarSelect options were not being saved and recovered for older projects.
8) (#326) Added new Excel trend report option "SysCAD_TrendReport()" where options
   and tags can be listed vertically rather than in two horizontal rows for
   "TrendReport()" option. The options can be listed vertically any order below 
   the keyword SysCAD_TrendReport(ReportName), then there should be at least
   one (up to 5) blank cells, then all the tags should be listed.

Update 3 : 26 August 2005
------------------------------
1) A fix for a crash caused by a NAN (*) value in graphics annotation bars.
2) A fix for a PGM crash for Str parameter for Array class load file.
3) (#333) A fix for setting estimate data in manual tears.

Update 4 : 1 September 2005
------------------------------
1) PGM improvements: EndFile can be used as an alternative to $. Implemented new 
   functions: FltToStr(double Value), IntToStr(long Value), StrToFlt(Str Value)
   and StrToInt(Str Value).
2) (#320) Implemented the ability to declare arrays of user classes. This can
   only be done in the global scope. Use square braces "[" and "]" to index 
   array elements. First element is at index 0. Example of declaration would 
   be "MyClass C[5]". Examples to access a class member "C[0].a = 5"; 
   "C[i].Exec()"; "x = C[i].a + C[i].GetResult(g)".
3) For dynamic bar annotation, added the ability to set the colour for each
   of the bars.
4) (#287) Added the ability to include reactions in the multistore model.
5) (#302) Added the ability to block or allow solids/liquids/vapours from outlet
   pipes in the multistore model.
6) Added SetStopRequired and SetIdleRequired to SMDK API.

Update 5 : 17 September 2005
------------------------------
1) Added getSizePassingFraction and getFractionPassingSize to MIPSD in SMDK.
2) Fixed an error in manual tear for Bayer stream with Bayer feed calculator.
3) Added option "PlantModel.IncludeSpcCnvs" which by default is on. If this
   is switched off then the "special" specie engineering conversion units are 
   not created. eg reaction extent "%.H2O(l)"
4) Fixed a crash in PGM for large number of function string parameters.
5) Added ExcludeWatch command to PGM, which is used to make the variables of a
   class not visible in the access window. eg "ExcludeWatch C[0]"
6) For PGM array (and matrix) classes added the functions IncAt(Index, value) 
   and DecAt(Index,Value). eg "DataArray.IncAt(3, Qty)" is more effecient than
   "DataArray.SetAt(3, DataArray.GetAt(3) + Qty)"
7) (#307) Can move text as part of grouped graphics.

Update 6 : 29 September 2005
------------------------------
1) (#220,#324) Fixes to flash tank and shell&tube operation in dynamic
   transfer mode.
2) Fix for a tie with vapour flows in ProBal mode where the incorrect outlet 
   pressure was used if PSat was selected.
3) (#348) Fix for reaction HeatExchange Power option in dynamic mode.
4) (#349) Fix for COM interface for ProBal start, stop, etc.

Update 7 : 27 October 2005
------------------------------
1) (#372) Fixed error introduced in Update5 for shell&tube in flash train
   where if a new heater was used it would not condense steam.
2) (#350) IgnoreAreaLimit in the stand-alone shell&tube heat exchanger can
   now be used to fully condense all steam regardless of user specified HTC 
   and area.
3) Added an option for dynamic bars to include or exclude the labels.
4) (#354) Fixed error where the selection of Access97 for database format 
   was ignored for many of the create or save database options.
5) (#357) Fixed error for pressure conversion units for gauge pressures.
   Improved display on Conversions tab page in Project window.

Update 8 : 28 November 2005
------------------------------
1) (#366) Fixed problem for increasing number of stores for multistore with 
   shared reactions.
2) (#371) Fixed crash in PSD calulation of cut size in screen model.
3) (#374) Fixed error where data entered in a table in the access window for
   the screen partition curve or belt filter wash curve was ignored.
4) (#367) Added "Mid-time fraction" in historian, usefull in dynamic with
   large step size for storing and recovering values thant change occasionaly.

Update 9 : 22 February 2005
------------------------------
1) Implemented new Blend Optimiser model.
2) (#392) Fix for PSD for calculating MeanMass for a size range.
3) (#396) Added option when editing cfg file on the measurement page to set
   a Count Factor for calculating PSD particle count.
4) (#407) Implemented test for too many PSD intervals.
5) (#235) Fix for large memory usage in projects using SMDK properties.
6) (#408) Speed improvement in density convergence calculation in Bayer
   properties.
7) (#410) Implemented new tags in $Dyn for current day, month and year.
8) Added new PGM functions IsAlpha(str) and AlphToNum(Str).

Update 10 : 28 February 2005
------------------------------
1) Fix for a crash in screen model when more than 12 species have PSD.
2) Fix for a crash in shell&tube where flowrate in one strem is zero and the
   other stream is very large.

Update 11 : 13 March 2005
------------------------------
1) (#416) Added new method "Individual_PartCrv" to screen model to allow
   user to specify a separate partition curve for each solid with PSD data.
2) (#254) Engineering conversion units (in the popup conversions menu) are now 
   listed alphabetically except for the SI unit which is always shown at the
   top of the list.
3) Removed limit on number of conversion unit groups allowed. This was a problem
   for projects controling extents of many species because of the extra
   conversions created for %H2O(l), etc.
4) (#417) Added option in "$Dyn" access window to specify a filename of a
   text file with a list of all tags (ignoring first line) to be recorded in 
   the data historian.

Update 12 : 24 March 2005
------------------------------
1) (#421) Fixed error "unable to open ..\cfgfiles\cfgfiles\.." which sometimes
   occured for opening or creating a project.
2) Added field NoOfReactions to reaction block reporting count of sources, 
   reactions and sinks.
3) (#430) Added tag "IntervalCnt" to the "Sz" tab page in the Access window
   which returns the number of intervals in the PSD.
4) (#422) There are now 5 tuning factors for the cyclone model using the Plitt
   method they are F1 d50, F2 sharpness m, F3 pressure drop, F4 S, and F5 Liquid 
   overflow.
5) (#431) Fixed error in cyclone plitt method lynch partition calculation. 
   NOTE: This will affect the PSD distribution. 
   Added other corrections and improvements that are used if check box "OldCalcs"
   is not selected. Added display fields for Alpha and reference temperature.

Update 13 : 21 May 2006
------------------------------
1) (#439) Fixed crash where large number of species have PSD data.
2) Improved display of PSD data where more than one specie contains PSD data. All
   the cumulative PSD data is now displayed in a separate table.
3) (#417) Improveved functionality in "Dynamic Info" for managing a tag list of
   tags to be recorded in the historian.
4) If shown as column options in the PSD views, all the xxxG (eg QmCumG) options
   have been removed.
5) (#131) Corrected display for BPE in bayer streams. The equation for BPE is 
   based on the stream composition and temperature. For BPE displayed, the stream 
   temperature was incorrectly used, rather the pure water saturation temperature 
   at stream pressure should have been used. NOTE: The values displayed for BPE
   will change, however the correct BPE was used in flash calculations, etc.
6) (#450) Forced check for sequence number in the first reaction if any of the
   subsequent reactions have a sequence number defined.
7) (#452) Fixed error in reactions where the incorrect amount of source material
   was shown when any of the reactions used the FinalConc method.

Update 14 : 25 August 2006
------------------------------
1) In PGM declaration of variables, user can now specify only the conversion family 
   and the SI units are assumed. eg double flow@("Qm"); or double FracRqd*("Frac").
2) (#462,#466) Fixed error where profile file contained a single entry at time zero.
3) (#483) Added new field "RqdCalcMode" in direct contact heater for user to specify 
   the desired calculation mode. If the contact heater is in "stand alone" mode, then 
   "FinalTRqd" or "TRiseRqd" are used as maximum limits and NOT strict requirements.
4) (#487) In graphics when unable to insert a pipe, after 3 failed attempts to select 
   a source or destination unit, the commend is canceled (in past user was stuck).
5) (#494) Added option to set conveyor belt product discharge position to end without
   having to change position if belt length is changed.
6) (#505) Added "On" option to crusher. When off, output equals input.
7) (#506) SysCAD now uses .ini files in basefiles folder rather than the registry.
8) (#492) Fixed beltfilter calculation error. Washing curve is on a mass not volume 
   basis. Added warning message if solute is present in wash water. 
   NOTE: This fix will affect output streams.
9) (#512) Improved error message to report problem model if database error occurred
   during project save.
10) (#519) Fixed crash when blowdown was not connected to boiler.
11) (#431) Further cyclone Plitt method fixes. Use stream temperature for density
    calculations.
12) (#524) Added PrjName display field to PlantModel access window.


Update 15 : 29 August 2006
------------------------------
1) Allow use of Alumina2.DLL.

=============================================================================
================                SysCAD 9.1                   ================
=============================================================================

Build 120 : 9 September 2006
------------------------------
A) Model changes:
1) (#168) Implemented new "AutoVLE" functionality. This is an equilibrium finder
   that can be enabled for selected areas in a similar way to other qualities
   such as solubility. User is able to define options such as Relative Humidity,
   Saturated, SuperSaturated. Display of current RelHumidty , SpecHumidity, DewPt
   and other qualities is shown. AutoVLE is for water only.
2) Implemented a new Thermal Block in pipes where ...
3) Changed underlying data type for the general splitter model (GM) from float
   to double to improve numerical accuracy.
4) Implemented 4way-valve model.
5) Added functionality to pump and valve so that they can operate in dynamic
   transfer mode. In this mode the required maximum flowrate can be specified
   which corresponds to the 100% valve or pump position. In a line with multiple
   pumps, valves, etc the resultant flowrate will be the minimum of all the
   output "capacity" flowrates of all the equipment and pipes in the line.
   The valve and pump capacity can be specified in mass flow or volumetric flow.
6) Dynamic mode improvements to the compressor model and flow regulator block.
7) Added option for gain and offset options to the profile model. The profile 
   output is adjusted as output=value*gain+offset.
8) For reactions, added new msFinalFraction or mlFinalFraction Extent options.

B) Solver changes
1) (#170) Implemented a new "leaks" functionality for full dynamic mode. This
   allows for "leaks" or flow between the environment and models. The leaks would
   optionaly be from flanges on either end of a pipe. The flow may be in either
   direction. The leak flowrate would be dependent on the configuration of the
   "environment envelope area", the state of the model contents and the
   configuration of the leak parameters of the model.
2) Implemented new system "Area" model. Some model types allow "leak" flows of
   material to occur in any direction between the area and any number of pipes
   or units.
3) Enhancements and improvements to the Audit and Closure information page.
4) For pipes in dynamic transfer, the maximum allowed flow capacity tags have 
   been changed and the capacity can now be specified on a mass or volume flow
   basis. For old projects, set UseNewCapVars to true to use new options.
6) In dynamic transfer mode, there are now two mode options in pipes, these are
    "Transfer" as before and "Pipe". The "Pipe" option allows reverse flow in
    streams.
5) Various improvements to the solver for dynamic transfer mode.
6) Improvements to network analysis for dynamic with joins and tears.
7) Added support in dynamic transfer mode for reverse flow in pipes. The pump
   can be configured for reverse flow.
8) Implemented dynamic run to steady state option.

C) User Functionality changes:
1) Implemented new graphics group block functionality. This allows user to
   select a group of graphics and save these to a database. This group (or
   "template" or "assembly") can then be inserted as a group of models in the
   project. When inserting the group, the user can select from various options
   to set the tags of all the models inserted as part of the group. The group
   that has been saved can be used in other projects. This feature is effectively
   a type of block copy and past, as well as having other aplications.
2) Implemented new explorer window for selecting windows. This also shows all the 
   tags grouped by graphics page, model class or by filter selection. Various 
   options are available through right click popup menu. The Explorer window has
   a filter option that can be used to quickly search for a tag.
3) Implemented a bulk tag change option. This provides a range of filters and
   options to select a group of tags and then change this group of tags. The 
   selected tags can also be copied to the clipboard.
4) Added new options for trend and graphics window display options. For example
   'treat as one' overlays all graphics windows such that it appears like there
   is a single graphics window.
5) Implemented new Excel report SysCAD_AutoTags(ReportName, H/V, MaxColCount, 
   MaxRowCount, Option1, Option2...). A SQL select and orderby type statement 
   can be specified as an option to select the primary tags to be included. 
   The report first returns all the tags that meet the selection statement 
   criteria, and then the data as for a normal SysCAD_Tags(...) report. Example: 
   SysCAD_AutoTags("Pipes", H, 200, 30, Select [Graphic]=="05_Flowsheet" and 
   [Type]=="Pipe", OrderBy Tag Asc)
6) Extended edit configuration dialog Step 1 page to include all groups of
   sub-models in the list of model types.
7) Improvements to the neutral database import/export of graphics and models.
8) Added new options to right click pop-up menu for the message window.

C) Other changes:
1) Upgraded licensing to use crypkey 6.5.
2) Syscad91.exe is now the main aplication file. Syscad.exe is a license utility
   aplication. The license, by default is now located in the folder "License"
   and not the "bin" folder. The correct syscad.exe and crp320001.ngn files must
   be located in this folder.

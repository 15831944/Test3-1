Smart PropertyGrid License Agreement 

The enclosed software that includes source code, demos, libraries and documentation (hereinafter
the "Software") is licensed, not sold, to you by VisualHint for use only under the terms of this
License, and VisualHint reserves any rights not expressly granted to you. You own the media on which
the Software is recorded or fixed, but VisualHint retains ownership of the Software itself.


1. License:

The Software is "in use" (or the term "use" is written) when you develop any source code depending on
the Software, modified or not.

VisualHint grants to you the license that allows a single developer to use only one copy of the
Software on a single computer at any one time. A full site license allows any developer to use the
Software on any computer inside your company at only one site. You are not required to pay any royalty
fees for the Software.

Under the terms of this license you may:

1.1. Incorporate the libraries into any number of products provided that the Software does not
constitute the major portion of these products. The Software must be incorporated in binary (for MFC
products) and obfuscated form (for .Net products), as supplied by VisualHint in the Software, or in a
reobfuscated form and embedded in your own software if .Net sources have been modified by you (the
same strong level of obfuscation is expected and you will have to contact VisualHint support to ensure
that this operation is done right). The process of building or packaging your product with the
Software can be done by any person at your company without a purchased license as long as the terms
and conditions of this EULA are respected.
1.2. Make an unlimited number of copies with any modifications in any fashion, provided that such
copies shall be used only internally, contain this license agreement and are not distributed or
republished.
1.3. Use and modify the library examples, provided you do not distribute or republish the Examples, or
any modified version of the Examples in the source code form.

VisualHint retains the right not to give you support if modifications of the source code have been
done in the Software, depending on the modifications and at the sole discretion of VisualHint.

You shall not:

1.4 Republish any part of the Software (original or modified) in a context different from the
    permitted use mentioned above unless you have received a written permission from VisualHint.
1.5 Incorporate the Software into your products if it is part of a package expressly labeled by
    VisualHint as "beta", "demo", "eval" or any other term from the same category.
1.6 Expose the Software API in the products you publish.
1.7 Redistribute the Software as part of a software development library without a written permission
    from VisualHint.
1.8 Lend, give, rent, lease, sub-license and transfer the Registered Software and related materials
    to other parties without the written permission of VisualHint.
1.9 Use the software in Canada except if you pay to VisualHint the applicable sales taxes.

2. Copyright:

The Software is owned by VisualHint and this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the Province
of Quebec, Canada.

3. LIMITED WARRANTY/LIMITATION OF LIABILITY:

This Software is licensed "AS IS". If for any reason you are dissatisfied with the Software,
remove it from your computer system and destroy all copies of it. These warranties are in lieu
of any other warranties, expressed or implied, including the implied warranties of merchantability
and fitness for a particular purpose. In no event will VisualHint be liable to you for damages,
including any loss of profits, lost savings, or other incidental or consequential damages arising
out of your use of or inability to use the Software, even if VisualHint has been advised of the
possibility of such damages.

4. INDEMNIFICATION:

By installing and using the Software, you hereby agree to save and hold harmless VisualHint from any
loss, direct or consequential damage, or claim incurred by you resulting from reliance upon the
results obtained through the use of the Software.
